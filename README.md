# Nexus Point Frontend Tech Challenge

## Introduction

Essential

- Pixel Perfect, responsive HTML/CSS
- Accessible
- Well structured and easily readable

We use Vue/Nuxt and have provided a basic nuxt starter.
Whilst preferable to use Vue/Nuxt we understand that if you know a frontend framework, adapting to Vue is fairly straightforward.
If you believe you can really show off your skills by using React/Next or similar Framework instead we are happy for you to do that.

This challenge is to develop one of our standard Search Results Pages (SRP).
